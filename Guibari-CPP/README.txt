Until I can effectivly use C# to build a GUI I will have a C++ form.

Goals:
	Milestones:
		Make GUI window: TODO
		ADD A way to interface with (FUTURE) Shibari mapping router/filter: TODO
	Overview:
		1. Open configuartion file
		2. Check if file has been filled, If so go to step 5, otherwise go to next step
		3. Prompt user to specify where shibari is
		4. Store in a file
		5. Open gui
		6. Wait for (Run Shibari {version}) button to be pressed or for (Configure controller) button
		7. Procede depending on action (8 if run {?} if configure)
		8. Open shibari and send configuration to filter
	Steps done: none so far
